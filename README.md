# pointcloud2-tools
Repository for manipulating ROS pointcloud2 data types for plane extraction and object detection for NVidia Jetson TX2

## Summary:
The Jetson TX2, while an extremely efficient and powerful processing board, is often limited in its compatibility with a variety of different operational packages due to it's Arm64 processor architecture. One such incompatible package is the pointcloud package for Python. This repository serves to provide specific pointcloud library package functionality for ROS scipts using Python, and the PointCloud2 message type.

### Dependencies:
1. rospy
2. std_msgs
3. numpy
